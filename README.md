# PureTabs

Firefox extension to show tabs as a tree, written in Purescript and heavily inspired by
[TreeTabs](https://gitlab.com/kroppy/TreeTabs). 

Massive WIP for now. `TreeTabs` is currently unmaintained and the code is quite difficult to follow.
This is an occasion for me to both learn Purescript and re-write it in a cleaner and more
maintainable way. Any criticism is welcome.

## TODO
